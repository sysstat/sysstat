.TH SYSSTAT 5 "JULY 2018" Linux "Linux User's Manual" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
sysstat \- sysstat configuration file.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This file is read by
.BR sa1 (8)
and
.BR sa2 (8)
shell scripts from the sysstat's set of tools.
It consists of a sequence of shell variable assignments used to
configure sysstat logging.
The variables and their meanings are:
.TP
.B COMPRESSAFTER
Number of days after which daily data files are to be compressed.
The compression program is given in the
.B ZIP
variable.

.TP
.B HISTORY
The number of days during which a daily data file or a report
should be kept. Data files or reports older than this number of
days will be removed by the
.BR sa2 (8)
shell script.
Data files and reports are normally saved in the @SA_DIR@ directory,
under the name
.IR saDD
(for data files) or
.IR sarDD
(for reports), where the DD parameter indicates the current day.

The number of files actually kept in the @SA_DIR@ directory may be
slightly higher than the
.B HISTORY
value due to the way the
.B sa2
script figures
out which files are to be removed (see below "How the
.BR sa2 (8)
script applies
.B HISTORY
value"). Using a value of 28 keeps a whole month's worth of data. If
you set
.B HISTORY
to a value greater than 28 then you should consider using
.BR sadc 's
option -D to prevent older data files from being overwritten (see
.BR sadc (8)
manual page). In this latter case data files are named
.IR saYYYYMMDD
and reports
.IR sarYYYYMMDD ,
where YYYY stands for the current year, MM for the
current month and DD for the current day.

How the
.BR sa2 (8)
script applies
.B HISTORY
value

The
.B sa2
script uses the "find" command with the "-mtime" option to figure
out which files are to be removed. The "find" command interprets this value
as "N 24 hour periods", ignoring any fractional part. This means that the
last modified time of a given sa[r]DD data or report file, using a
.B HISTORY
of 1, has to have been modified at least two days ago before it will be
removed. And for a
.B HISTORY
of 28 that would mean 29 days ago.

To figure out how a
.B HISTORY
of 28 is applied in practice, we need to
consider that the
.B sa2
script that issues the "find" command to remove the
old files typically runs just before mid-night on a given system, and since
the first record from
.B sadc
can also be written to the previous day's data file
(thereby moving its modification time up a bit), the
.B sa2
script will leave
30 files untouched. So for a setting of 28, and counting the data file of
the current day, there will always be 31 files (or 30 files, depending on the
number of days in a month) in the @SA_DIR@ directory during the majority
of a given day.  E.g.:

April 30th: 31 files (Apr 30th-1st, Mar 31th)
.br
May 1st: 30 files (May 1st, Apr 30th-2nd)

Yet we can note the following exceptions (as inspected at Noon of the given
day):

February 28th: 31 files (Feb 28th-1st, Jan 31st, 30th & 29th)
.br
March 1st: 30 files (Mar 1st, Feb 28th-2nd, Jan 31st & 30th)
.br
March 2nd: 29 files (Mar 1st & 2nd, Feb 28th-3rd, Jan. 31st)
.br
March 3rd: 28 files (Mar 1st-3rd, Feb 28th-4th)
.br
March 4th - March 28th: 28 files
.br
March 29th: 29 files
.br
March 30th: 30 files
.br
March 31st: 31 files

(Determining the number of files in March on a leap year is left as an
exercise for the reader).

Things are simpler if you use the sa[r]YYYYMMDD name format.
Apply the same logic as above in this case and you will find that there
are always
.B HISTORY
+ 3 files in the
.IR /var/log/sa
directory during the majority of a given day.

.TP
.B REPORTS
Set this variable to false to prevent the
.B sa2
script from generating reports (the
.IR sarDD
files).

.TP
.B SA_DIR
Directory where the standard system activity daily data and report files
are saved. Its default value is
.IR @SA_DIR@ .

.TP
.B SADC_OPTIONS
Options that should be passed to
.BR sadc (8).
With these options (see
.BR sadc (8)
manual page), you can select some additional data which are going to be saved in
daily data files.
These options are used only when a new data file is created. They will be
ignored with an already existing one.

.TP
.B YESTERDAY
By default
.BR sa2
script generates yesterday's summary, since the cron job
usually runs right after midnight. If you want
.BR sa2
to generate the summary of the same day (for example when cron
job runs at 23:53) set this variable to no.

.TP
.B ZIP
Program used to compress data and report files.
