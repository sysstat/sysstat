.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B sar
command writes to standard output the contents of selected
cumulative activity counters in the operating system. The accounting
system, based on the values in the
.I count
and
.I interval
parameters, writes information the specified number of times spaced
at the specified intervals in seconds.
If the
.I interval
parameter is set to zero, the
.B sar
command displays the average statistics for the time
since the system was started. If the
.I interval
parameter is specified without the
.I count
parameter, then reports are generated continuously.
The collected data can also
be saved in the file specified by the -o
.I filename
flag, in addition to being displayed onto the screen. If
.I filename
is omitted,
.B sar
uses the standard system activity daily data file (see below).
By default all the data available from the kernel are saved in the
data file.

The
.B sar
command extracts and writes to standard output records previously
saved in a file. This file can be either the one specified by the
-f flag or, by default, the standard system activity daily data file.
It is also possible to enter -1, -2 etc. as an argument to
.B sar
to display data
of that days ago. For example, -1 will point at the standard system
activity file of yesterday.

Standard system activity daily data files are named
.I saDD
or
.IR saYYYYMMDD ,
where YYYY stands for the current year, MM for the current month and
DD for the current day. They are the default files used by
.B sar
only when no filename has been explicitly specified.
When used to write data to files (with its option -o),
.B sar
will use
.I saYYYYMMDD
if option -D has also been specified, else it will use
.IR saDD .
When used to display the records previously saved in a file,
.B sar
will look for the most recent of
.I saDD
and
.IR saYYYYMMDD ,
and use it.

Standard system activity daily data files are located in the
.I @SA_DIR@
directory by default. Yet it is possible to specify an alternate
location for them: If a directory (instead of a plain file) is used
with options -f or -o
then it will be considered as the directory containing the data files.

Without the -P flag, the
.B sar
command reports system-wide (global among all processors) statistics,
which are calculated as averages for values expressed as percentages,
and as sums otherwise. If the -P
flag is given, the
.B sar
command reports activity which relates to the specified processor or
processors. If -P ALL
is given, the
.B sar
command reports statistics for each individual processor and global
statistics among all processors. Offline processors are not displayed.

You can select information about specific system activities using
flags. Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.
Specifying the -A
flag selects all possible activities.

The default version of the
.B sar
command (CPU utilization report) might be one of the first facilities
the user runs to begin system activity investigation, because it
monitors major system resources. If CPU utilization is near 100 percent
(user + nice + system), the workload sampled is CPU-bound.

If multiple samples and multiple reports are desired, it is convenient
to specify an output file for the
.B sar
command. 
Run the
.B sar
command as a background process. The syntax for this is:

.B sar -o datafile interval count >/dev/null 2>&1 &

All data are captured in binary form and saved to a file (datafile).
The data can then be selectively displayed with the
.B sar
command using the -f
option. Set the
.I interval
and
.I count
parameters to select
.I count
records at
.I interval
second intervals. If the
.I count
parameter is not set, all the records saved in the
file will be selected.
Collection of data in this manner is useful to characterize
system usage over a period of time and determine peak usage hours.

Note:	The
.B sar
command only reports on local activities.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -A
This is equivalent to specifying
.BR "-bBdFHqSuvwWy -I SUM -I ALL -m ALL -n ALL -r ALL -u ALL -P ALL".
.IP -B
Report paging statistics.
The following values are displayed:

.B pgpgin/s
.RS

.RS
Total number of kilobytes the system paged out to disk per second.
.RE

.B fault/s
.RS
Number of page faults (major + minor) made by the system per second.
This is not a count of page faults that generate I/O, because some page
faults can be resolved without I/O.
.RE

.B majflt/s
.RS
Number of major faults the system has made per second, those which
have required loading a memory page from disk.
.RE

.B pgfree/s
.RS

Number of pages scanned directly per second.
.RE

.B pgsteal/s
.RS
Number of pages the system has reclaimed from cache (pagecache and
swapcache) per second to satisfy its memory demands.
.RE

.B %vmeff
.RS
Calculated as pgsteal / pgscan, this is a metric of the efficiency of
page reclaim. If it is near 100% then almost every page coming off the
tail of the inactive list is being reaped. If it gets too low (e.g. less
than 30%) then the virtual memory is having some difficulty.
This field is displayed as zero if no pages have been scanned during the
interval of time.
.RE
.RE
.IP -b

The average service time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests that were issued
to the device. Warning! Do not trust this field any more. This field will be
removed in a future sysstat version.
.RE

.B %util
.RS
Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O requests were issued to the device
(bandwidth utilization for the device). Device saturation occurs when this
value is close to 100% for devices serving requests serially. But for
devices serving requests in parallel, such as RAID arrays and modern SSDs,
this number does not reflect their performance limits.

to omit output for any devices for which there was no activity during the
sample period.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The
.B sar
command takes into account the following environment variables:

.IP S_COLORS
When this variable is set, display statistics in color on the terminal.
Possible values for this variable are
.IR never ,
.IR always 
or
.IR auto
(the latter is the default).

Please note that the color (being red, yellow, or some other color) used to display a value
is not indicative of any kind of issue simply because of the color. It only indicates different
ranges of values.

.IP S_COLORS_SGR
Specify the colors and other attributes used to display statistics on the terminal. 
Its value is a colon-separated list of capabilities that defaults to
.BR C=33;22:H=31;1:I=32;22:M=35;1:N=34;1:R=31;22:Z=34;22 .
Supported capabilities are:

.RS
.TP
.B C=
SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) substring for comments inserted in the binary daily
data files.

.TP
.B H=
SGR substring for percentage values greater than or equal to 75%.

.TP
.B I=
SGR substring for item names or values (eg. network interfaces, CPU number...)

.TP
.B M=
SGR substring for percentage values in the range from 50% to 75%.

.TP
.B N=
SGR substring for non-zero statistics values.

.TP
.B R=
SGR substring for restart messages.

.TP
.B Z=
SGR substring for zero values.
.RE

.IP S_TIME_DEF_TIME
If this variable exists and its value is
.B UTC
then
.B sar
will save its data in UTC time (data will still be displayed in local time).
.B sar
will also use UTC time instead of local time to determine the current daily
data file located in the
.IR @SA_DIR@
directory. This variable may be useful for servers with users located across
several timezones.

.IP S_TIME_FORMAT
If this variable exists and its value is
.B ISO
then the current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the report header.
The
.B sar
command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.
The timestamp will also be compliant with ISO 8601 format.
.SH EXAMPLES
.B sar -u 2 5
.RS
Report CPU utilization for each 2 seconds. 5 lines are displayed.
.RE

.B sar -I 14 -o int14.file 2 10
.RS
Report statistics on IRQ 14 for each 2 seconds. 10 lines are displayed.
Data are stored in a file called
.IR int14.file .
.RE

.B sar -r -n DEV -f @SA_DIR@/sa16
.RS
Display memory and network statistics saved in daily data file 'sa16'.
.RE

.B sar -A
.RS
Display all the statistics saved in current daily data file.
.SH BUGS
.I /proc
filesystem must be mounted for the
.B sar
command to work.

All the statistics are not necessarily available, depending on the kernel version used.
.B sar
assumes that you are using at least a 2.6 kernel.
.SH FILES
.I @SA_DIR@/saDD
.br
.I @SA_DIR@/saYYYYMMDD
.RS
The standard system activity daily data files and their default location.
YYYY stands for the current year, MM for the current month and DD for the
current day.

.RE
.I /proc
and
.I /sys
contain various files with system statistics.
