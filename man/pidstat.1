.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pidstat
command is used for monitoring individual tasks currently being managed
by the Linux kernel.
It writes to standard output activities for every task selected with option
.B -p
or for every task managed by the Linux kernel if option
.B -p ALL
has been used. Not selecting any tasks is equivalent to specifying
.B -p ALL
but only active tasks (tasks with non-zero statistics values)
will appear in the report.

The
.B pidstat
command can also be used for monitoring the child processes of selected tasks.
Read about option
.B -T
below.

The
.I interval
parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds between each report.
A value of 0 (or no parameters at all) indicates that tasks statistics are
to be reported for the time since system startup (boot).
The
.I count
parameter can be specified in conjunction with the
.I interval
parameter if this one is not set to zero. The value of
.I count
determines the number of reports generated at
.I interval
seconds apart. If the
.I interval
parameter is specified without the
.I count
parameter, the
.B pidstat
command generates reports continuously.

You can select information about specific task activities using flags.
Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-C comm"
Display only tasks whose command name includes the string
.IR comm .
This string can be a regular expression.
.IP -d
Report I/O statistics (kernels 2.6.20 and later only).
The following values may be displayed:

.B UID
.RS
.RS
The real user identification number of the task being monitored.
.RE

.B USER
.RS
The name of the real user owning the task being monitored.
.RE

Number of kilobytes the task has caused, or shall cause to be
written to disk per second.
.RE

.B kB_ccwr/s
.RS
Number of kilobytes whose writing to disk has been cancelled by
the task. This may occur when the task truncates some
dirty pagecache. In this case, some IO which another task has
been accounted for will not be happening.
.RE

.B iodelay
.RS
Block I/O delay of the task being monitored,
measured in clock ticks. This metric includes the delays spent
waiting for sync block I/O completion and for swapin block I/O
completion.

.RE
.RE
.IP "-e program args"
Execute
.IR program
with given arguments
.IR args
and monitor it with
.B pidstat.
.B pidstat
stops when
.IR program
terminates.
.IP "-G process_name"
Display only processes whose command name includes the string
.IR process_name .
This string can be a regular expression. If option -t is used
together with option -G then the threads belonging to that
process are also displayed (even if their command name doesn't
include the string
.IR process_name ).
.IP -H
Display timestamp in seconds since the epoch.
.IP -h
Display all activities horizontally on a single line, with no
average statistics at the end of the report. This is
intended to make it easier to be parsed by other programs.

The units displayed with this option supersede any other default units (e.g.
kilobytes, sectors...) associated with the metrics.
.IP -I
In an SMP environment, indicate that tasks CPU usage
(as displayed by option
.B -u
) should be divided by the total number of processors.

.RE
.IP "--csv file_path"
Output statistics to the given file in CSV format.  What statistics to
output is selected by the options above.  This option causes them to be
written to a CSV file, in addition to being printed to the console.

The column names are similar to the ones output to the console.  However,
there is less processing done when outputting to CSV.  For example, instead
of reporting CPU utilization just as a percentage, the number of clock ticks
spent in user, kernel and guest operations is reported, as well as the
interval duration in clock ticks.  Column names also indicate the units for
the values in them.  (E.g., "VSZ_kb" for virtual memory size in KB,
"B_rd" for bytes read, or "wait_ticks" for the number of ticks the CPU spent
waiting for the process to run).
.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The
.B pidstat
command takes into account the following environment variables:

.IP S_COLORS
When this variable is set, display statistics in color on the terminal.
Possible values for this variable are
.IR never ,
.IR always
or
.IR auto
(the latter is the default).

Please note that the color (being red, yellow, or some other color) used to display a value
is not indicative of any kind of issue simply because of the color. It only indicates different
ranges of values.

.IP S_COLORS_SGR
Specify the colors and other attributes used to display statistics on the terminal.
Its value is a colon-separated list of capabilities that defaults to
.BR H=31;1:I=32;22:M=35;1:N=34;1:Z=34;22 .
Supported capabilities are:

.RS
.TP
.B H=
SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) substring for percentage values greater than or equal to 75%.

.TP
.B I=
SGR substring for item values like PID, UID or CPU number.

.TP
.B M=
SGR substring for percentage values in the range from 50% to 75%.

.TP
.B N=
SGR substring for non-zero statistics values and for tasks names.

.TP
.B Z=
SGR substring for zero values and for threads names.
.RE

.IP S_TIME_FORMAT
If this variable exists and its value is
.BR ISO
then the current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the report header.
The
.B pidstat
command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.
The timestamp will also be compliant with ISO 8601 format.

.SH EXAMPLES
.B pidstat 2 5
.RS
Display five reports of CPU statistics for every active task in the system
at two second intervals.
.RE

.B pidstat -r -p 1643 2 5
.RS
Display five reports of page faults and memory statistics for
PID 1643 at two second intervals.
.RE

.B pidstat -C """fox|bird"" -r -p ALL
.RS
Display global page faults and memory statistics for all the
processes whose command name includes the string "fox" or "bird".
.RE

.B pidstat -T CHILD -r 2 5
.RS
Display five reports of page faults statistics at two second intervals
for the child processes of all tasks in the system. Only child processes
with non-zero statistics values are displayed.
.SH BUGS
.I /proc
filesystem must be mounted for the
.B pidstat
command to work.

.SH FILES
.IR /proc
contains various files with system statistics.
