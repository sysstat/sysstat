.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B sadf
command is used for displaying the contents of data files created by the
.BR sar (1)
command. But unlike
.BR sar ,
.B sadf
can write its data in many different formats (CSV, XML, etc.)
The default format is one that can
easily be handled by pattern processing commands like awk (see option -p).

The
.B sadf
command extracts and writes to standard output records saved in the
.I datafile
file. This file must have been created by a version of
.B sar
which is compatible with that of
.B sadf.
If
.I datafile
is omitted,
.B sadf
uses the standard system activity daily data file.
It is also possible to enter -1, -2 etc. as an argument to
.B sadf
to display data of that days ago.
For example, -1 will point at the standard system
activity file of yesterday.

The standard system activity daily data file is named
.I saDD
or
.IR saYYYYMMDD ,
where YYYY stands for the current year, MM for the current month and
DD for the current day.
.B sadf
will look for the most recent of
.I saDD
and
.IR saYYYYMMDD ,
and use it. By default it is located in the
.I @SA_DIR@
directory. Yet it is possible to specify an alternate location for it:
If
.I datafile
is a directory (instead of a plain file) then it will be considered as
the directory where the standard system activity daily data file is
located.

The
.I interval
and
.I count
parameters are used to tell
.B sadf
to select
.I count
records at
.I interval
seconds apart. If the
.I count
parameter is not set, then all the records saved in the data file will be
displayed.

All the activity flags of
.B sar
may be entered on the command line to indicate which
activities are to be reported. Before specifying them, put a pair of
dashes (--) on the command line in order not to confuse the flags
with those of
.B sadf.
Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -C
Tell
.B sadf
to display comments present in file.
.IP -c
Convert an old system activity binary datafile (version 9.1.6 and later)
to current up-to-date format. Use the following syntax:

.B sadf -c old_datafile > new_datafile

.IP -d
Print the contents of the data file in a format that can easily
be ingested by a relational database system. The output consists
of fields separated by a semicolon. Each record contains
the hostname of the host where the file was created, the interval value
(or -1 if not applicable), the timestamp in a form easily acceptable by
most databases, and additional semicolon separated data fields as specified
by
.I sar_options
command line options.
Note that timestamp output can be controlled by options -T, -t and -U.
.IP "-e [ hh:mm[:ss] ]"
Set the ending time of the report, given in local time. The default ending
time is 18:00:00. Hours must be given in 24-hour format.
.IP -H
Display only the header of the report (when applicable). If no format has
been specified, then the header data (metadata) of the data file are displayed.
.IP -h
When used in conjunction with option -d, all activities
will be displayed horizontally on a single line.
.IP -j
Print the contents of the data file in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
format. Timestamps can be controlled by options -T and -t.
.IP "-P { cpu [,...] | ALL }"
Tell
.B sadf
that processor dependent statistics are to be reported only for the
specified processor or processors. Specifying the
.B ALL
keyword reports statistics for each individual processor, and globally for
all processors. Note that processor 0 is the first processor.
.IP -p
Print the contents of the data file in a format that can
easily be handled by pattern processing commands like awk.
The output consists of fields separated by a tab. Each record contains the
hostname of the host where the file was created, the interval value
(or -1 if not applicable), the timestamp,
the device name (or - if not applicable),
the field name and its value.
Note that timestamp output can be controlled by options -T, -t and -U.
.IP "-s [ hh:mm[:ss] ]"
Set the starting time of the data (given in local time), causing the
.B sadf
command to extract records time-tagged at, or following, the time
specified. The default starting time is 08:00:00.
Hours must be given in 24-hour format.
.IP -T
Display timestamp in local time instead of UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
.IP -t
Display timestamp in the original local time of the data file creator
instead of UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
.IP -U
Display timestamp (UTC - Coordinated Universal Time) in seconds from
the epoch.
.IP -V
Print version number then exit.
.IP -x
Print the contents of the data file in XML format.
Timestamps can be controlled by options -T and -t.
The corresponding
DTD (Document Type Definition) and XML Schema are included in the sysstat
source package. They are also available at
.I http://pagesperso-orange.fr/sebastien.godard/download.html

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The
.B sadf
command takes into account the following environment variable:

.IP S_TIME_DEF_TIME
If this variable exists and its value is
.BR UTC
then
.B sadf
will use UTC time instead of local time to determine the current daily data
file located in the
.IR @SA_DIR@
directory.
.SH EXAMPLES
.B sadf -d @SA_DIR@/sa21 -- -r -n DEV
.RS
Extract memory and network statistics from system activity
file 'sa21', and display them in a format that can be ingested by a
database.
.RE

.B sadf -p -P 1
.RS
Extract CPU statistics for processor 1 (the second processor) from current
daily data file, and display them in a format that can easily be handled
by a pattern processing command.
.RE

.SH FILES
.I @SA_DIR@/saDD
.br
.I @SA_DIR@/saYYYYMMDD
.RS
The standard system activity daily data files and their default location.
YYYY stands for the current year, MM for the current month and DD for the
current day.
